## Description:

In our fast-paced world where digital distrations keep our eyes on the screen, we often overlook the things which make our cities or towns unique/beautiful.  Using Boston, MA as a starting point, this application makes it easy to discover and contribute to the documentary of public art in one's local area or around the world.  Using a simple form, the user can input information about a piece of public art they have discovered, upload a photo, and see the art marked on a google map.  The hope is that through this documentary of public art, people will discover a new sense of place about the lcoations that they live.
