================

In our fast-paced world where digital distrations keep our eyes on the screen, we often overlook the things which make their city or town unique/beautiful.  That is, the things that give a location a sense of place, like public art.  Using Boston as a starting point, my application will leverage technology (such as google maps, twitter, and instagram) and the plethora of public art infused into the city to get people to lift their heads to the world that surrounds them.  The two core features of this app are 1) Help people discover public art.  The user will be able to enter a zipcode which will then show a filtered gallery and google map with pins of public art in that zipcode. 2) Help people contribute to the documentary of public art.  The user will be able to contribute to this documentary of public art by submitting the art-piece via our app directly, or via twitter &amp; instagram using a specific hash tag
